# Blockchain Based Tender Management System

## Overview

This project presents a blockchain-based tender and contract management system designed to enhance transparency, security, and efficiency in procurement processes. Implemented using Solidity and deployed over the Ethereum network, the system features two user interfaces: one for buyers and one for vendors.

## Features

- **Tender Creation**: Buyers can create tender requests by selecting items, which are then sent to vendors for review.
- **Vendor Interaction**: Vendors can view these requests, accept them, and provide quotes, initiating the negotiation process.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automates various processes, including tender creation, acceptance, and contract generation.
- **Secure Transactions**: Integration with MetaMask enables secure transaction processing.
- **Blockchain Transparency**: Ensures transactions are securely managed and transparently tracked on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Technology Stack

- **Solidity**: For writing smart contracts.
- **Ethereum**: Blockchain platform for deploying contracts.
- **MetaMask**: For secure transaction processing.
- **Ganache**: For local blockchain testing.
